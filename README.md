## [CloudBees CEO: State of Software Development is a Disaster](https://devops.com/cloudbees-ceo-state-of-software-development-is-a-disaster/)

The idea that DevOps has caused an overall decrease in productivity is an interesting take that runs counter to my prior understanding of the subject. However, despite the hook in the title and the beginning of the article, it does shift to a more mid-ground perspective part of the way through.  
Overall, the discussion about AI and LLMs in the article was the most interesting to me. It makes sense that LLMs would help make DevOps, and software engineering as a whole, more efficient. I wonder how long it will take for those changes to start making notable impacts on the workplace, especially considering the security concerns involved with sharing sourcecode with ChatGPT.

I find the article's point about how developers spend only 30% of their time writing code very interesting. My guess is that the majority of their time is in testing and validating that their code does what it is supposed to do - Although AI is progressing in automating the testing processess, it still makes a lot of "meaningless tests" and so developers still need to take a lot of time to make genuine unit tests for their code...Also, I too have been wondering about the security concern sharing sourcecode with chat GPT. Many companies do not allow developers to share code with ChatGpt because though AI may add value, it is not a part of the company and should not have any access to confidential code.

This is an interesting article - I had not thought about how AI would contribute to DevOps and only had known that it's been applied to writing unit tests/routine tasks. I'm curious about what kinds of DevOps tasks that can be optimized and how AI would work with OS and low-level programming.
